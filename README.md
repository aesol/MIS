        <div><h1><strong>Warren Buffett’s </strong><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">WORST NIGHTMARE</span></strong><br/><strong>Is About to Come True</strong></h1>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What happens when the perfect business model sustains a direct hit from the brightest minds at one of Silicon Valley’s most innovative firms? </strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tough to say exactly. But here’s what experts DO anticipate… </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>CNBC predicts this burgeoning industry will be the “new battleground for tech companies.” </strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Forbes</em></strong><strong> magazine estimates it will soon generate $2 trillion a year in sales and “even more market cap.”</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>KPMG advises we’re “on the cusp of revolutionary change” coming much “sooner than you think.”</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Even one legendary MIT professor had to recant his position that the technology was “beyond the capability of computer science.” (He recently confessed to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that he’s now a believer and amazed “how quickly this technology caught on.”)</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>So if you’ve missed out on tech’s legendary winners, like Microsoft in 1986 (and the <span style="color: #008000;">60,000%+ gain</span> that followed), AOL and Amazon.com in the ‘90s (and a <span style="color: #008000;">20,000%+</span> and <span style="color: #008000;">9,500%+</span> gain, respectively), or 3D Systems more recently <span style="color: #000000;">(a <span style="color: #008000;">309%</span></span><span style="color: #008000;"> gain</span> and growing)…</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Here’s your next and -- <em>quite possibly</em> -- LAST chance to cash in on an emerging industry with earth-shattering potential… before the crowd catches on.</strong></h3>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dear Cutting-Edge Investor,</p>
<p>The love affair began 62 years, 10 months, 9 days ago.</p>
<p>When 20-year-old Warren Buffett piled <em>more than</em> <em>half</em> his net worth into just one company.</p>
<p>At the time, you’d have thought him nuts. After all, <strong>he basically bought the stock out of fascination</strong>.</p>
<p>He discovered that his idol, Benjamin Graham, owned a controlling block of the company’s stock and sat on its board of directors.</p>
<p>But he also noticed that Graham’s recent book, <em>Security Analysis</em>, was silent on the company.</p>
<p>Which sparked his curiosity.</p>
<p>So the young Buffett hopped a train to the company’s headquarters to find out what the company was all about -- and to unravel why Graham might be so secretive about the opportunity.</p>
<p>Once there, he discovered the mathematical precision of auto insurance underwriting, why the company could sell at prices cheaper than their competitors, and -- most important -- how the premiums collected gave it investable “float.”</p>
<p>And he returned home with his “first business love.”</p>
<p>To say it’s been a successful relationship would be an understatement.  </p>
<p>And he knows it. Buffett admits, “when I count my blessings, I count GEICO twice,” and that it “changed my life.”</p>
<p>Because over those 62 years, 10 months, and 9 days, the company gobbled up market share <em>and</em> became more profitable.</p>
<p>More important, the master investor and his lieutenants have had GEICO’s nearly $13 billion float at their disposal to invest as they’ve seen fit.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>However this easy money may soon come to an end!</strong></h2>
<p>An emerging technology from within the heart of Silicon Valley has the potential to destroy GEICO’s business as we know it.</p>
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers says this technology will “<strong>significantly disrupt</strong> the traditional auto insurance industry.”</p>
<p>Renowned tech author Chunka Mui admitted in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations: “The immediate losers are the people who depend on accidents for their businesses.” </p>
<p>Even a former exec at Allstate acknowledges that, over the long term, “car insurance goes away.”</p>
<p>Why? Because self-driving cars are moving from the realm of science fiction into reality.</p>
<p>Now… I know what you’re thinking…</p>
<p>Because, when I first heard this crazy idea, I thought the same thing:</p>
<p><em>Self-driving cars? You’ve gotta be kidding me!</em></p>
<p><em>That sort of technology won’t ever happen on a large scale. There are too many hurdles in the way… it just simply won’t work!</em></p>
<p>But as I’m going to share with you just below, the technology is already here. The hurdles are slowly being jumped. And this “crazy idea” has the potential to make early investors untold fortunes.</p>
<p>You see, even slow-to-act governments are preparing for the transition with new laws. Companies in the tech industry, the oil industry -- even the legal industry -- are all scrambling to prepare for the effect it will have on their business.</p>
<p>There’s no question the shift is coming… it’s <strong>really only a question of when</strong>. And even that may be closer than any futurist ever expected. </p>
<p>But here’s the kicker (and the real reason I’m writing you today)… as a gathering of tech leaders in San Jose, California at the end of March made certain (a meeting that received <em>almost no media coverage</em>!)… <strong>one shocking company stands at the forefront of taking this technology mainstream.</strong></p>
<p>This company is pursuing partnerships with the biggest names in the auto industry. It’s investing nearly one-third of its revenue into R&amp;D to ensure its hardware is the hands-down favorite among automakers.</p>
<p>And its CEO has been on a whirlwind tour both through the tech world (including addressing a “jam-packed” room at January’s Consumer Electronics Show) and in closed-door meetings with auto execs -- explaining why its hardware is capable TODAY of taking self-driving cars “from the realm of research into the mass market.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>And here’s the best part...</strong></h2>
<p>Investors with the foresight to buy this company’s stock today stand to create a legacy of wealth for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>It’s how the stock picker who keyed me in to this stock has developed a long track record of life-changing investments in life-changing technological shifts. (More on him in a minute).</p>
<p>But it’s important to realize that the real money will be made <strong><em>before</em></strong> this company’s hardware is found in every car… <strong><em>before</em> </strong>its technology goes mainstream… and <strong><em>before</em> </strong>most investors even make the connection between this massive shift and this company.</p>
<p>Now before we go any further, let me get something out of the way. Because I definitely don’t want you to get the wrong idea.</p>
<p>Although self-driving cars could be disastrous to GEICO’s business, that’s <strong>not going to destroy the empire Buffett has built</strong>.</p>
<p>As a $300 billion conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway is so well-diversified that even a shake-up as massive as the one self-driving cars will have on GEICO won’t destroy Buffett’s business empire.</p>
<p>But <em>the same is not true for most other companies</em>.</p>
<p>So you can understand why tech giants Apple, Google, and Intel are scrambling to claim their piece of the action…</p>
<p>Why academics at the most elite schools of engineering, including the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford have dedicated millions to researching the technology…</p>
<p>And why the CEOs of Nissan, GM, and Tesla are all vying be the first company to sell autonomous cars to the public.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>But reading these kinds of news clips will cause many investors to make the wrong choice</strong></h2>
<p>You see, many stock pickers will try to pick the winning car manufacturer. Others will get sidetracked by fancy in-car technology like Apple’s CarPlay or GM’s built-in Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>But the technology I’m sharing with you today has much greater potential.</p>
<p>I’ll explain exactly what I mean in just a second. But first, allow me to clarify what a self-driving car actually is.</p>
<p>To start with, it’s been given many names: autonomous car, driverless car. I’m referring to them as self-driving cars. But they all basically mean the same thing: a car that’s able to drive without a human in constant control of the steering wheel.</p>
<p>This is achieved through a slew of sensors placed throughout the car that constantly scan the car’s surroundings and create a virtual “map” that a computer can use to know where the car should travel.</p>
<p>This is possible by using <em>lidar</em>, which uses laser pulses to create a 3-D map of the car’s surroundings about 200 feet in diameter. There are <em>cameras</em>, which detect lane boundaries and changes in traffic signals. Then there’s <em>sonar</em> to detect objects at a closer range. And <em>GPS</em> for navigation.</p>
<p>All of this data gets input into a computer, analyzed, and responded to in a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>It’s a technological miracle built on top of 30 years of research and innovation.</p>
<p>Of course, the tricky part about programming a self-driving car isn’t teaching a computer when to turn… or coding a camera to detect the speed limit.</p>
<p>It’s that -- with all these inputs -- <strong>these cars are “data guzzlers,”</strong> as <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>recently put it. TRILLIONS of bytes of data are constantly pouring in, changing in real time, and requiring rapid responses.</p>
<p>Clearly these decisions must be precise. (Lives are on the line!)</p>
<p>But even the first version of Google’s self-driving car “is driving more smoothly and more safely than our trained professional drivers,” according to the head of the project.</p>
<p>In fact, it has logged half a million miles without even the tiniest accident. (The average American driver typically gets in an accident after just half that number.)</p>
<p>And that’s one of the main reasons why these cars pack so much potential.</p>
<p>You see, even though cars are drastically safer than they were even just 20 years ago, 40,000 Americans continue to die in car accidents each year. Another 2 million are injured.</p>
<p>Even more startling, car accidents are the leading cause of death of Americans under 35. And they cost us more than half a trillion dollars -- in repairs, medical bills, legal fees, etc.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Actually, when you think about it, we waste TONS of money every year behind the wheel</strong></h2>
<p>The average American wastes 34 hours sitting in traffic each year. Multiply that by the number of workers who commute daily and you get $422 billion in lost productivity.</p>
<p>Traffic also wastes fuel -- totaling up to another $158 billion. (Of course, there’s also pollution, which causes roughly $19 billion in health-related issues.)  </p>
<p>Then consider the billions that governments waste on building, maintaining, and patrolling the roads we have.</p>
<p>Self-driving cars would be more efficient users of the road, meaning that we could add 6 times the number of cars to the road without so much as paving another lane.</p>
<p>One Morgan Stanley analyst added up driving’s “wasted billions” and estimated that self-driving cars could free up as much as $2.2 trillion in economic value… every year!</p>
<p>Of course there are <em>also the unquantifiable benefits</em> of streamlining our nation’s roadways.</p>
<p>The stress your body experiences while you drive are as high as it is when you participate in extreme sports like skydiving. Road rage is downright dangerous to your health.</p>
<p>In a fully self-driving car, the experience will go from the stressful extreme to the relaxing extreme. Going for a drive will give you the opportunity to watch a movie or play a game with your children.</p>
<p>Or you might not even go for a drive at all -- maybe you'll send the car to pick up the kids from school! </p>
<p>And it will do more than just change your life on a personal level.</p>
<p>As legendary technologist Bran Ferren pointed out in a recent TED talk, the world’s greatest civilizations had roads to thank for their success. Roads “were as essential to the success of the Roman Empire as the interstate highway system to the prosperity of the United States.”</p>
<p>Which is why he’s convinced self-driving cars “<strong><em>will be the key technology that enables us to redesign our cities and, by extension, civilization</em></strong>.”</p>
<p>In other words, we can’t even fathom how much self-driving cars will impact our world.</p>
<p>And regardless of what form these cars take -- whether they’re semiautonomous, fully autonomous, or something altogether different -- this technology will make our roads safer. And it’s coming. Soon.</p>
<p>A fresh report from Morgan Stanley predicts these cars will begin rolling out in 2018… and will fully penetrate the driving world in just two decades.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Of course, there are the inevitable naysayers. (There always are!)</strong></h2>
<p>Some argue that the amount of data collected by these cars is an affront to our right to privacy. Others wonder where liability falls if there’s ever a computer glitch that causes an accident.</p>
<p>Some experts (including the chief technology officer at Ford and Google’s director of engineering, Ray Kurzweil) predict we won’t own cars in the future, but we’ll summon them as we need them -- similar to buses and trains, but more personal.</p>
<p>But these problems are nothing to get tripped up on. They will get worked out.</p>
<p>Even the car faced similar objections early on.</p>
<p>Don’t forget… horses are more autonomous than cars; they can get safely from one point to another (of course, not necessarily the intended point) if the human driving is drunk, falls asleep, or otherwise isn’t paying attention.  </p>
<p>And yet people were gradually able to see past that fact to see the bigger picture and the other, more significant benefits of driving cars. And in just two decades, car ownership soared from 8,000 to 8 million.</p>
<p>Of course, the hardest part will be simply convincing people to give it a shot. Many wonder how we could trust a computer to do something that’s ingrained in us to do for ourselves.</p>
<p>But as a recent NPR story drives home, <strong>by the time these cars go mainstream, you’ll be so accustomed to ceding control</strong>, “because you’ll have already handed over control tens of thousands of times,” that you won’t even think twice.  </p>
<p>In fact, the car you’re driving today likely has automatic features on it -- albeit basic ones.</p>
<p>If your vehicle has an antilock braking system or stability assistance, that’s what the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calls “function-specific automation.”</p>
<p>In 2006, Lexus came out with the LS640, which was able to parallel park itself, starting a trend of cars that could do the same.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, if you’re in the market for a new luxury vehicle this year… you’ll have <em>even more advanced automation</em>. The 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 can actually drive itself in traffic. BMW’s X5 has similar technology.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important part of my letter to you…</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>NOW is the time to take this investment opportunity seriously</strong></h2>
<p>You see, with world-changing technology, the money isn’t made when everyone owns the technology.</p>
<p><strong><em>The big money is made somewhere between widespread popular disbelief and when the technology is found in every home</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Like with Microsoft in ’86… <em>before</em> the home PC revolution took off (and handed early investors <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>a 60,000%+ gain</strong></span>).</p>
<p>Then with AOL in ’94… <em>before</em> everyone and their grandma were using those shiny “free Internet” CDs (handing early investors <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>a 20,000%+ gain</strong></span>).</p>
<p>And with Amazon.com in ’97 -- when the thought of buying books (along with everything else they sell) still seemed futuristic (then handed investors <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>a 9,500%+ gain</strong></span>).</p>
<p>And lastly with 3D Systems in 2012… <em>before</em> the masses became convinced of the massive potential 3-D printing represents (handing investors <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>a 309% gain -- and rising</strong></span>!)</p>
<p>Which is why the live-streaming feed of a tech conference from San Jose, California on March 25 stole my undivided attention.</p>
<p>The CEO of one of Silicon Valley’s most well-respected companies was giving the keynote address.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn’t recognize him by name. After all, <strong><em>he’s not really the Steve Jobs -- or even Tim Cook -- type</em></strong>. He’s content running a behind-the-scenes hardware company that doesn’t usually make headlines.</p>
<p>But as he was sharing his company’s latest advancements, he held the audience in the palm of his hands.</p>
<p><em>After an hour and a half, the CEO throws a curveball…</em></p>
<p>And introduces the head of product development from one of the world’s elite automakers.</p>
<p>Together, they walk the audience through a video explaining what the two companies are working on -- showing how sensors map out a virtual landscape that allows a car to determine where it should travel.</p>
<p>Then the automaker VP says, “I brought something with me…”</p>
<p><em>All eyes dart stage right as a sleek, silver sedan slowly drives toward them</em>… and smoothly parks diagonally next to the two men.</p>
<p>They go to open the driver-side door… no one is there!</p>
<p>They walk around the side, coming to the trunk. Opening it up, they reveal the driver… by holding up the central CPU “manning” the car (roughly the size of a notebook, it fits snugly off to one side.)</p>
<p>The rep from the automaker then explains that the critical component powering the CPU is this tech company’s newest mobile processor.</p>
<p>He explains that this processor “brings supercomputing power into the car,” and admits that with normal PCs, these sort of rapid calculations are not possible in real time.</p>
<p>The tech company’s CEO concedes that developing this processor was the “<strong>most ambitious project</strong> we’ve ever worked on.” And that it’s “<strong>impossibly advanced</strong>.”</p>
<p>A press release also explained that this processor provides “<strong>10 times the computing power</strong> of previous mobile processors without consuming additional energy.” And that it’s the same level of technology “that powers the <strong>world’s 10 most energy-efficient supercomputers</strong>.”</p>
<p>Gary Vasilach, founding editor of <em>Automotive Design &amp; Production</em>, one of the leading publications for automotive engineers, stood in awe, later writing that, “with four processors per car, a two-car garage would have <strong>as much computing power as the $120 million Blue Mountain supercomputer installed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1998</strong>.”</p>
<p>And that’s where many experts have this company incorrectly pegged -- and why most investors haven’t caught on to this tech company’s true potential…</p>
<p>Since the company has developed a “mobile processor,” some analysts argue that the company is behind the times -- that it doesn’t have a strong selling point with smartphone manufacturers. </p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>But it seems that could actually be this company’s goal!</strong></h2>
<p>You see… this company isn’t merely competing in the present. <em>It’s also battling for the future</em>.</p>
<p>This tech superstar knows that, in a matter of mere years, “<strong>The car will be the smartest device</strong>.” Some experts are already calling it the “next smartphone.”</p>
<p>As he closed out his keynote address, the CEO predicted: “the car is going to be the most amazing robot we own. Future cars will be computers first. With four wheels. And they will do things most computers can’t or maybe never will.”</p>
<p>Then consider that this company already has their products in more than 4.5 million cars (and growing!) -- in everything from Porsches and Maseratis to Volkswagens and Hyundais… even Teslas! </p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The importance of this fact can't be overstated</span></em>.</p>
<p>Because even if self-driving cars take longer than most experts are predicting to go mainstream (let's say 10 years, or maybe even 20), smaller changes in autonomous functions will continue to come to market.</p>
<p>And, as these get more complex, they will require powerful chips capable of handling these complicated functions (like those this company is already selling). And because of their established partnerships with the major automakers, this company will be the clear choice to provide the computing power. </p>
<p>By now, I’m sure you understand why we’re so excited about the opportunity self-driving cars present, especially for this under-the-radar tech company.  </p>

<p>Of course, it’s this ability to sniff out megagrowth stocks <strong>before</strong> Wall Street catches on that has allowed Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner to amass an enviable track record of investing success. </p>
<p>(And it’s helped him and his brother Tom build a track record that we Motley Fool employees enjoy bragging about!)</p>
<p>In fact, since the brothers founded their <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor </em>investment newsletter in 2002, David has recommended over 100 profitable stocks for his followers, and DOZENS of stocks that have risen more than 100%.</p>
<p>In just over a decade, he’s achieved an average return of over 230% on his recommendations. That’s nearly quadruple what the market has done over the same time period.</p>
<p>And he’s on record recommending once-in-a-lifetime winners like AOL in 1994, Amazon in 1997, and 3D Systems in 2012.</p>
<p>(Of course, he hates when I bring up his past winners, because he doesn’t want someone to mistake him as a one-hit wonder.)</p>
<p>But that couldn’t be further from the truth…</p>
<p>In fact, a randomly selected portfolio taken from among the 150 stock recommendations David Gardner has published since 2002 beat the S&amp;P 500 an astonishing 92.6% of the time. And it produced a positive return 100% of the time!</p>
<p>How does he do it?</p>
<p>Simple: He picks great companies. Not great bubbles.</p>
<p>After all, truly timing the market -- picking the right stock on the right minute of the right day -- is impossible.</p>
<p>But good investments are made for the long term. Not 100 years, mind you. 5 is enough. 10 is even better.</p>
<p>But this concept is foreign to Wall Street.</p>
<p><strong>Strangely enough, this means making great investments is easy</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially when you can track down a top dog AND first mover.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What’s a “top dog”? And what’s a “first mover”?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s pretty simple, really.</p>
<p>A “top dog” is a company that dominates its industry… and a “first mover” is a company with a technology or product so revolutionary that it disrupts an existing industry and creates an entirely new one.</p>
<p>And on those rare occasions when you find a company that’s <em>both</em> a top dog and a first mover, <strong>chances are you’ve found your next huge winner</strong>…</p>
<p>Like Amazon.com in the online retail market, Netflix in the DVD-rental market, or Priceline in the travel industry… (David led investors to big gains on all three, and still recommends them to <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> members.)</p>
<p>These three companies redefined the way business was done and dominate their industries to this day. (And you don’t need me to tell you how handsomely they’ve rewarded shareholders along the way.)</p>
<p>So you can see why David and his team of analysts work around the clock to find those few companies that are both top dogs and first movers.</p>
<p>And that’s the opportunity David sees this tech company having in self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Now, I so badly wish I could tell you the name and ticker symbol of this company…</p>
<p>But it wouldn’t be fair to the members who already pay for David’s advice in <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em>. And yet I don’t want you to miss out on what could potentially be a life-changing gain by not knowing the full story behind this investment opportunity.</p>
<p>So here’s what I’m going to do instead…</p>

<h3 class="subhead-sidebar" style="text-align: left;">Mark and Isabel retired early thanks to <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em>...</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What will it help you achieve?</h3>
<p><img alt="Mark &amp; Isabel" height="131" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/art/shop/newsletters/18/18-MarkIsabel.jpg" width="224"/></p>
<p><em>Mark and Isabel Hardesty lost everything in the "dot com" bubble. But since then, they've done so well with their Stock Advisor investments that this Arizona couple is getting ready to retire...at the ripe old age of 55!</em></p>
<p><strong>So tell us: </strong><strong>Why did you join the <em>Stock Advisor </em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isabel </strong>: Let's see... can anyone say "tech-boom crash"? <br/><br/><strong>Mark </strong>: I rode it all the way down. And I said "alright, I've proven I'm an idiot... YOU take over!" She's a lot smarter than I am -- she got subscribed to the <em>Stock Advisor </em>, and pretty soon things started going in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>What have your biggest Stock Advisor winners been?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isabel </strong>: Priceline, for me. I bought it when it was first recommended at $20 a share, and never sold anything.</p>
<p><strong>That stock recently crossed $1,000, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isabel </strong>: Yea... not that I'm watching! <br/><br/><strong>Mark </strong>: I'm pretty pleased with Netflix and Google.</p>
<p><strong>So how has the money from those winners -- Priceline, Google, Netflix -- translated into your everyday life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isabel </strong>: Well, for us it's meant freedom. We're going to quit next year and take off and sail around the world. <br/><br/><strong>Mark </strong>: I've just turned 55... the contribution [ <em>Stock Advisor </em>] has made to that is we know we can leave and we'll be fine. We've built enough additional padding -- it's freedom.</p>
<p><strong>So would you say that, as an investment, your <em>Stock Advisor</em>membership has paid off?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isabel </strong>: Yes! <br/><br/><strong>Mark </strong>: Like spades... the payback has been THOUSANDS of percent. And it's always great reading!</p>

<p>And the best part?</p>
<p>I’ll send it to you absolutely free of charge.</p>
<p>That’s right… full in-depth coverage of this incredible wealth-building opportunity… 100% free!</p>
<p>All I ask in return is that you ensure your family’s financial well-being by taking me up on a special offer…</p>
<p>It’s my personal invitation to enjoy everything our <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> community has to offer…</p>
<p><strong><em>With NO RISK and absolutely NO OBLIGATIONS</em>.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, for 30 days, you’ll have the chance to profit from every single one of the 209 winning stocks David Gardner and his brother Tom have shared exclusively with their award-winning community of forward-thinking investors.</p>
<p>These are world-class companies, researched by two internationally renowned stock pickers and their top-notch team of equity analysts.</p>
<p>And for a limited time, you will get access to their entire collection of profit-building advice <strong>without having to risk a single dime</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Introducing Our “Keep Everything and Risk Nothing” DOUBLE GUARANTEE</strong></h2>
<p>You see, the team at <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor </em>has been helping everyday investors absolutely CRUSH the market for over a decade. When I say they’re good at what they do, I’m not exaggerating…</p>
<p>I’m talking about hundreds of thousands of lives improved by insightful, easy-to-understand financial advice.</p>
<p>Which is why I’m so excited to share an offer like this with you today…</p>
<p>You can try out every single wealth-creating resource and recommendation <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> has to offer…</p>
<p>And if you aren’t entirely satisfied after a full month, I’ll personally refund your money -- down to the last penny -- <strong>no questions asked.</strong></p>
<p>215 profitable recommendations (and counting)… dozens of “multibagger” picks… exclusive interviews with CEOs like Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and Elon Musk of Tesla Motors… 24/7 access to live member chats and conversations with the world’s top equity analysts… up-to-the-minute audio and video coverage of the market’s most promising stocks and stories…</p>
<p><em>PLUS</em> a complimentary copy of the must-read stock advice in <strong><em>The Brains Behind Self-Driving Cars: The One Company Paving Technology’s Future</em></strong>…</p>
<p><em>PLUS </em>three additional high-value reports I’ll describe in just a minute…</p>
<p>All yours to keep. Without any risk whatsoever.</p>
<p>In fact, I’m so confident you’ll be blown away by your <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor </em>experience that I’ll even guarantee you a full, prompt refund for the remainder of your membership at any point <em>after</em> your first 30 days.</p>
<p>But I honestly don’t think that’ll be necessary.</p>
<p>Because when you see the kind of consistent returns <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> has to offer, you won’t want to miss out on the next big winner.</p>
<p>I’m talking about companies like:</p>
<div>
<ul class="returns">
<li><strong>Tesla Motors: </strong> Up <strong class="positive">601% </strong></li>
<li><strong>BorgWarner: </strong> Up <strong class="positive">894% </strong></li>
<li><strong>Activision Blizzard: </strong> Up <strong class="positive"> 1,240% </strong></li>
<li><strong>Amazon.com: </strong> Up <strong class="positive">1,944% </strong></li>
<li><strong>Netflix: </strong>Up <strong class="positive">3,157%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Walt Disney: </strong> Up <strong class="positive">4,275% </strong></li>
<li><strong>Priceline: </strong>Up <strong class="positive">5,141%</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And that’s just a few. The full list is much longer.</p>
<p>Of course, anyone can cherry-pick a list of stocks that make him look like a brilliant stock picker.</p>
<p>But real wealth is built on consistently investing in winners. Which is why I think you’ll find this graph so impressive:</p>
<p><img alt="Cumulative Growth of $10,000" height="362" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/art/shop/newsletters/18/18-CumulativeDavidGgraph-2.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="500"/></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">If you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 index in March 2002, by November 30, 2013 you could have watched it grow to $19,756. Not bad. But if you had invested that same $10,000 in March 2002 and earned the annualized returns of David Gardner's recommendations, it would have grown to an incredible $76,292.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>As you can see, David Gardner picks investments with mind-blowing consistency.</strong></h2>
<p>But don’t just take my word for it…</p>
<p>Here’s what some of our current members are saying about their experience.</p>
<p>Neil A., of Brookline, Mass., calls his <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> subscription “<strong>the best money I spend… I extract FAR more value than I am paying in</strong>.”</p>
<p>And Dennis in Arizona writes that “<strong>this has been such a good investment for my family. I feel so much more secure about our future</strong>.”</p>
<p>When you subscribe today, I’m convinced you’ll feel the same.</p>
<p>After all, <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em>’s simple, actionable stock picks have changed the future of countless everyday investors.</p>
<p>So because you’ve been so generous with your time by hearing me out today…</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>I’m going to offer you a one-time-only new-member introductory price</strong></h2>
<p>Now, our CFO doesn’t like my slashing prices on our products.</p>
<p>And I don’t blame him.</p>
<p>After all, membership in <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> comes with the highest-quality investing resources in the entire world.</p>
<p>On top of access to all of David Gardner’s market-thumping recommendations -- and two brand-new stock picks every month -- as a member you’ll also receive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly issues updating you on how our Core Stocks and Best Buys Now are performing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Breaking alerts by email with important market news that impacts your portfolio</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exclusive interviews with power players from the world of finance (like John Bogle from Vanguard) and some of the top CEOs in the world (like John Mackey from Whole Foods)</strong></li>
<li><strong>24/7 access to our lively online discussion boards -- the world's first (and best!) watercooler for great investing ideas</strong></li>
<li><strong>A full, no-B.S. scoreboard for all the picks we've ever made in</strong> <em><strong>Stock Advisor</strong></em><strong>. David calls it "</strong> <em><strong>Moneyball</strong></em><em> </em><strong>for the financial world," and you won't find it anywhere else.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For perks like these and returns like those I’ve shared with you, my CFO knows we could easily charge <em>thousands of dollars a year</em> for full access. (And he knows we’d have a <strong><em>much larger</em></strong> bank account if we actually did charge that.)</p>
<p>But that’s not at all the case…</p>
<p>You see, our company’s purpose is “to help the world invest -- better.”</p>
<p>And we realize that we’d be limited in our scope if we charged thousands of dollars for each year of membership.</p>
<p>Which is why a full year of <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> usually sells for just $199. (Given the returns I’ve shared with you today, I’m sure you’ll agree that’s a bargain in itself.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>But I know you’re a forward-thinking investor, eager to learn the name of the stock that could go down in history as the next David Gardner history maker…</strong></h2>
<p>And so if you join right now through this special offer, I’m going to give you a chance to lock in an even lower price. In fact, it’s the lowest price we’ve ever offered.</p>
<p>You’ll get TWO FULL YEARS of <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> for just $98. That’s $300 OFF the regular membership rate!</p>
<p>Of course, if you’d like to subscribe for only one year, you’re welcome to join at the special rate of just $49. Again, that’s <strong>75% LESS</strong> than what many investors are currently paying!</p>
